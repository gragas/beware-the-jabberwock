# Beware the Jabberwock

This is my project for [UIUC](http://cs.illinois.edu/)'s CS 241-96.

## Overview
I want to write an isometric game in C with OpenGL and SDL. It should have multiplayer support and involve threading/multiprocessing for performance boosts.

## Purpose
By the end of this project, I plan to:

1. Have an intermediate grasp of SDL and OpenGL.
2. Be able to write tests and use continuous integration with C.
3. Know how to use threading/multiprocessing to improve performance significantly.
4. Be able to implement simple networking for games (UDP/TCP)
5. Be able to write Makefiles confidently.

## Why is it cool?
It's cool because I've always wanted to make a "real" game. I will also have a solid understanding of essential systems programming techniques.

## Expected workload distribution among group members
I'm the only member of this group. I expect to at least complete a minimum viable product by the end of the semester.

## Project Milestones

*Week Number, Task*

1. [x] Hello, World! SDL/OpenGL screen
2. [ ] Basic isometric rendering in SDL/OpenGL
3. [ ] Basic area/map loading and basic demonstration of movement
4. [ ] Animated movement
5. [ ] Complete area/map loading (one continuous map)
6. [ ] Saving/loading
7. [ ] UI/Hotbar, basic stats
8. [ ] Multiplayer/networking support
9. [ ] NPCs
10. [ ] Items
11. [ ] Combat
12. [ ] Additional content (quests, homes, biomes, etc.)

## Expected challenges
I'm not sure how to write tests for graphics. How do we know that graphics are displayed correctly?

I'm not familiar with cross-platform systems programming development. What do I need to do to ensure Linux/OSX/Windows support?
